    <h1>Decisions</h1>
    <h2>Some decisions!</h2>
<p>Not final decisions or conclusions necessarly, but thoughts that are currently guiding my ideas and choices.</p>
<h3>Content in Markdown</h3>
<p>I'm a fan of markdown and intend to also leverage the meta feature that Python's markdown offers. </p>
<p>I see each .md file as a standalone artifact that, within itself, has no 'knowlege' of the website. As such the meta-data should strictly be focussed on the content and file. This excludes including website related data such as taxonomy/tags navigation information etc.</p>
<h3>Framework status</h3>
<p>There are plenty of staic site generators out there. Building my own as a learning experience is my primary motivation. I also have a few personal Django websites that could work well as static sites. So I have some practical use cases too.  </p>
<p>Some of my websites are a hotch-potch of design and coding and on occasion I want to show entire interfaces separate from my core site theme. This is my motivation to keep design and development options open and progress jinn as a framework. </p>
