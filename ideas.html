    <h1>jinn: Thinking as I go</h1>
    <p>Not just ideas but thoughts around what needs addressing still.</p>
<h2>CSS</h2>
<p>how to handle css? For me the days of SASS are over as css natively has all the features I used sass for. Still leaves some options around what I could do...</p>
<ul>
<li>copy into the build folder and link to there (<em>this is what is currently happening</em>)</li>
<li>concatinate it all together</li>
</ul>
<h2>Site validation</h2>
<p>I should include some validation to ensure the build site is error free as much as possible when generating. I've gotten site nav and links wrong several times already with just 3 and 4 pages.</p>
<h2>Authoring formats</h2>
<p>Some ideas...</p>
<ul>
<li>Cater for .rst format</li>
<li>Cater for HTML content (that doesn't need parsing)</li>
<li>include 'chapters' in .md meta to allow content in multiple .md file to be linked 'internally' - saved on listing each file in a page config.</li>
</ul>
<p>It might be nice to be able to inject some customised html into a markdown file content. This would avoid needing to break .md file up to include blocks of html (eg interactive diagrams, thumbnail galleries etc) within the content.</p>
<p>Python-Markdown has an extension API, which is might be the way to go. I need to experiment with suppored features.</p>
<h2>Processing on build</h2>
<p>Possibly not for default jinn, but I'm think of doing some image processing - converting jpg to webp formats for my gallery images. Wonder if I could make a hook to allow user functions to run on build?</p>
<h2>hyperlinks</h2>
<p>should I figure out how to do relative and absolute options for generating hyperlinks? Might fall to the user and how they present the pagedata? </p>
<h2>3 layers? framework &gt; application &gt; user project</h2>
<p>It has occured to me a nice project arrangement might be to expect a middle layer 'application' between the framework and end user. This middle layer might enforce filing structure to allow site generation with no additional coding.  </p>
