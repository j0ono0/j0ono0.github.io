# j0ono0.github.io

Static website for my github just for fun. 

It is currently a static site generator created with Python, Jinja2, and Markdown. Some broad goals:

- Maintain a coherent site-wide style
- Keep things flexible to allow disparate content to be added with minimal resistance
- Streamline the content creation and publishing processes

Things are a total mess but you can checkout the latest output at <a href="https://j0ono0.github.io">j0ono0.github.io</a>
