Just another page. to see how content might be filed and used.

Things not immediately obvious include the use of Markdown Meta-data. It is included at the top of each markdown content page and makes for a handy way to include some meta data with the content. 

It might become painful pattern for image heavy content? I could potentially have a .md file for every media item. 

Maybe that wouldn't be so bad. The file could include:

- src
- title
- description (long and short?)
- alt text
- related thumbnail(s)
- image-set alternatives
- size alternatives
