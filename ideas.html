    <h1>Some more thoughts</h1>
    <p>Just another markdown doc. to see how content might be filed and used.</p>
<p>Things not immediately obvious include the use of Markdown Meta-data. It is included at the top of each markdown content page and makes for a handy way to include some meta data with the content. </p>
<p>It might become painful pattern for image heavy content? I could potentially have a .md file for every media item. </p>
<p>Maybe that wouldn't be so bad. The file could include:</p>
<ul>
<li>src</li>
<li>title</li>
<li>description (long and short?)</li>
<li>alt text</li>
<li>related thumbnail(s)</li>
<li>image-set alternatives</li>
<li>size alternatives</li>
</ul>
<p>other thoughts...</p>
<ul>
<li>how to handle css.</li>
<li>concatinate it all together</li>
<li>
<p>copy into the build folder and link to there (<em>this is what is currently happening</em>)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Validating that data is correct as much as possible when generating!!! I've gotten site nav and links wrong several times already with just 3 and 4 pages.</p>
</li>
<li>Markdown is nice, but I could also support .rst?</li>
<li>Thinking about overriding some Markdown but feel like it's a bad idea to mess with expected output from it.
  My motive is the desire to  support some more html tags with 'short-hand' markup. Specifically using image-set to serve webp images and jpg/png fallback.</li>
<li>Related to above - auto-processing images to useful formats. eg creating thumbnails and webp versions (even image-sets) for a gallery component.</li>
<li>silly name ideas about the 'magical' ease of creating an html site from static content:</li>
<li>site 'generator' -&gt; genie-rator</li>
<li>jinni-rator, djinn-erator. plays on 'Jinja' module name too.</li>
</ul>
