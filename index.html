    <h1>Site-Genie-rator, Introduction</h1>
    <h2>Python site generator is go</h2>
<p>Built using Python, Jinja2, and Markdown. This page has been generated locally and pushed to github.</p>
<p>The biggest question in my mind is how to structure content, templates, and themes. Currently I'm thinking 'prose' is stored as markdown docs and 'configuration' data (page urls, navigation menus, tags, etc) stored as python lists and dictionaries. This content could then be applied to templates that result in chunks of HTML. The HTML chunks can, in turn, be applied to further templates until a final page is complete. </p>
<p>I'm up to version 2 of how I might structure these things. Generally it's looking really promising with a balance between flexibility, neat content filing, easy authoring, and consistent styling.</p>

    <section>
    <h1>Some more thoughts</h1>
    <p>Just another markdown doc. to see how content might be filed and used.</p>
<p>Things not immediately obvious include the use of Markdown Meta-data. It is included at the top of each markdown content page and makes for a handy way to include some meta data with the content. </p>
<p>It might become painful pattern for image heavy content? I could potentially have a .md file for every media item. </p>
<p>Maybe that wouldn't be so bad. The file could include:</p>
<ul>
<li>src</li>
<li>title</li>
<li>description (long and short?)</li>
<li>alt text</li>
<li>related thumbnail(s)</li>
<li>image-set alternatives</li>
<li>size alternatives</li>
</ul>
<p>other thoughts...</p>
<ul>
<li>how to handle css.</li>
<li>concatinate it all together</li>
<li>copy into the build folder and link to there</li>
</ul>
