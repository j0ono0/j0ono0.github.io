        <h2>Python site generator is go</h2>
<p>Built using Python, Jinja2, and Markdown. This page has been generated locally and pushed to github.</p>
<p>The biggest questions in my mind are how to structure content. Currently my thoughts go to authoring chunks of content that can be used to popluate components. The components are then combined into page layouts.</p>
<p>Should images be filed as their own piece of content and referenced from other pieces of content, or just grouped with that content? Maybe the former where the images will be used across multiple components and the latter when it is just used within a single component? </p>
